# AI Code Guide

## Rules *(unless user suggests otherwise)*

1. **No Repetition** - Extract logic into functions
2. **No Hard Coding** - Use variables, read from data sources
3. **No VS Code Browser** - Don't run/build projects
4. **No JSâ†’TS Conversion** - Don't fix TypeScript issues
5. **Single Task Focus** - Don't volunteer extra fixes
6. **Embrace Uncertainty** - It's okay to not know everything
7. **Prefer map over forEach** - Use functional programming patterns
8. **Use library functions** - If included, prefer d3.sum, d3.groups, d3.mean over native alternatives
9. **String matching** - Prefer direct equality for known values over includes
10. **Preserve defaults** - Don't modify default values unless specifically asked
11. **Data & State Management** - Preserve existing data flow, reactive statements, transformation chains and add new functionality without disrupting existing patterns
12. **Variable renaming** - Only update actual variable names and identifiers, not string literals, text content, or display text
13. **Lint handling** - Don't automatically fix lint warnings unless explicitly requested, focus on user's actual request over style suggestions
