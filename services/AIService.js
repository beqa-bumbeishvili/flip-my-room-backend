SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:
- INPUT (to you): Image 1 (markedImage - the room to edit) + Image 2 (textureImage - material reference)
- OUTPUT (from you): A complete prompt that Imagen will use with ONLY Image 1
- CRITICAL: Imagen will receive ONLY Image 1 + your prompt. It will NOT see Image 2.

YOUR TASK:
Analyze both images and generate a prompt that describes the material from Image 2 in precise textual detail, so Imagen can apply it to Image 1 without seeing Image 2.

PROMPT STRUCTURE:
[Action verb] + [specific marked area description] + [detailed material description from Image 2] + [preservation instructions] + [quality specifications] + [boundary constraints]

REQUIREMENTS:

1. ANALYZE IMAGE 1 (markedImage) and identify the marked/selected area:
   - Determine what surfaces are marked for transformation (walls, floors, specific objects)
   - Describe the location precisely (e.g., "the left wall", "all floor tiles", "the cabinet doors")
   - Note the extent of the marked area (partial or full coverage, specific sections)
   - Identify the current material/appearance of the marked area
   - Spatial relationships: which parts of the room are affected (e.g., "walls from floor to ceiling", "lower half of walls")

2. ANALYZE IMAGE 2 (textureImage) and extract:
   - Base color + undertones (e.g., "warm white with cream undertones")
   - Pattern details: veining, grain, geometric patterns (direction, scale, characteristics)
   - Finish type: matte, satin, glossy, polished, brushed
   - Reflectivity level: non-reflective, slight sheen, mirror-like
   - Material type if identifiable: marble, wood, ceramic, metal, fabric, stone
   - Texture qualities: smooth, rough, polished, textured

3. DESCRIBE THE TRANSFORMATION:
   - Start with action verb: "Replace/Change/Transform"
   - Use the precise marked area description from step 1 as your target
   - Include full material description from Image 2 analysis
   - Be specific about what is marked and what will change

4. PRESERVATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   - "Keep the exact [room/bathroom/space] layout unchanged"
   - "Preserve all fixtures, furniture, lighting, and camera angle"
   - "Maintain original room dimensions and proportions"

5. QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS:
   - "Photorealistic quality"
   - "Maintain lighting consistency with existing scene"
   - "Accurate shadows and reflections matching the original"

6. BOUNDARY CONSTRAINTS:
   - "Do not extend image boundaries"
   - "Same frame size and aspect ratio"
   - "In-place editing only, no canvas expansion"

CRITICAL RULES:
- Do NOT reference "Image 2" or "reference image" in your output
- Do NOT say "use the material from Image 2"
- Write as if only the markedImage exists
- Your prompt must be completely self-contained

REVISED EXAMPLES OF COMPLETE OUTPUTS:

Example 1 - Right Wall only:
"Take the texture/material shown in the first image and use it as a repeating tile pattern to completely cover the entire right wall surface in the second image. Tile this pattern repeatedly across the full right wall from floor to ceiling with no gaps."

Example 2 - Left Wall + Right Wall:
"Take the texture/material shown in the first image and use it as a repeating tile pattern to completely cover the entire left wall surface in the second image as well as the entire right wall surface. Tile this pattern repeatedly across the full left wall and right wall from floor to ceiling with no gaps."

Example 3 - Right Wall + Floor:
"Take the texture/material shown in the first image and use it as a repeating tile pattern to completely cover the entire right wall surface in the second image as well as the entire floor surface. Tile this pattern repeatedly across the full right wall from floor to ceiling and across the full floor with no gaps."

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:
- INPUT (to you): Image 1 (textureImage - material reference) + Image 2 (markedImage - room with GREEN DOT markers)
- OUTPUT (from you): A complete prompt for Gemini
- CRITICAL: Gemini will receive TWO images: [Image 1 (texture), unmarked original room, your prompt]
- Gemini will NOT see the green dots - you must convert dot markers into spatial text descriptions

🎯 GREEN DOT DETECTION METHOD:
Image 2 contains small GREEN CIRCLES (color: #00FF00, pure bright green, ~30px radius) marking surfaces to transform.
Your job: Find ALL green dots, identify which surface each dot is on, list unique surfaces.

YOUR DETECTION TASK:

STEP 1 - FIND ALL GREEN DOTS in Image 2:
□ Scan the entire image for BRIGHT GREEN circles (color #00FF00 - pure green, RGB 0,255,0)
□ These are small filled circles, approximately 10-20 pixels in radius
□ Very distinct and bright - will stand out clearly against the room
□ Count how many green dots you see total
□ Note the approximate position of each dot

STEP 2 - IDENTIFY WHICH SURFACE EACH DOT IS ON:

For EACH green dot you found, determine what surface it's marking:

A. Analyze dot position and surrounding context:
   - Where is this dot in the frame? (top, bottom, left, right, center)
   - What's the surface texture/material around the dot?
   - Is it on a horizontal surface (ceiling/floor) or vertical surface (wall)?

B. Classify each dot by surface type:
   - Dot on CEILING: Top portion of frame (upper 30%) on horizontal/overhead surface
   - Dot on FLOOR: Bottom portion of frame (lower 30%) on horizontal/ground surface  
   - Dot on LEFT WALL: Left side of frame on vertical surface
   - Dot on RIGHT WALL: Right side of frame on vertical surface
   - Dot on FRONT WALL: Center/back of frame on vertical surface (closest to viewer, if identifiable)

C. List each dot classification:
   Example: "Dot 1: on ceiling, Dot 2: on ceiling, Dot 3: on right wall, Dot 4: on floor"

STEP 3 - GROUP DOTS BY SURFACE:
□ Combine multiple dots on the same surface into one surface
□ Example: "Dots 1 & 2 both on ceiling → CEILING is marked"
□ Example: "Dot 3 on right wall → RIGHT WALL is marked"
□ Example: "Dot 4 on floor → FLOOR is marked"

STEP 4 - LIST UNIQUE MARKED SURFACES:
□ Write ONLY the unique surface names (one entry per surface, even if multiple dots)
□ Format: "CEILING + RIGHT WALL + FLOOR" or "LEFT WALL + FLOOR" or just "RIGHT WALL"
□ Do NOT list a surface if it has NO green dots on it
      
      EXAMPLES:
      
✅ CORRECT: Found 2 green dots (both on ceiling) → Output: "CEILING"
✅ CORRECT: Found 3 green dots (1 on ceiling, 2 on right wall) → Output: "CEILING + RIGHT WALL"
✅ CORRECT: Found 4 green dots (1 on floor, 2 on left wall, 1 on right wall) → Output: "FLOOR + LEFT WALL + RIGHT WALL"
✅ CORRECT: Found 1 green dot (on right wall only) → Output: "RIGHT WALL"

❌ WRONG: Found dots on ceiling and right wall, but output "CEILING + RIGHT WALL + FLOOR" (no dot on floor!)
❌ WRONG: Found 3 dots all on ceiling, but output "CEILING + CEILING + CEILING" (should be just "CEILING")
❌ WRONG: Confused left/right - dot on left side but called it right wall

CRITICAL RULES:
- ONLY include surfaces that have at least ONE green dot
- Multiple dots on same surface = list that surface ONCE
- LEFT WALL = left side of frame | RIGHT WALL = right side of frame
- Check for dots on ALL surfaces: ceiling, floor, left wall, right wall, front wall

STEP 5 - IDENTIFY ROOM ELEMENTS (Image 2):
Now that you've identified marked surfaces, just note:
- What major objects/fixtures are in the room (toilet, vanity, furniture, etc.)
- Which surfaces are unmarked (these will go in the "Keep unchanged" part)

STEP 6 - CONSTRUCT THE GEMINI PROMPT (SIMPLE & CLEAR FORMAT):

   Keep it SHORT and NATURAL. Use the "Take... and tile it repeatedly" format.
   DO NOT use "image 1" or "image 2" - use clearer references.
   Make it CRYSTAL CLEAR that the texture should be repeated as a tiled pattern.

   COMPLETE FORMAT:
   
   FOR SINGLE SURFACE:
   "Take the texture/material shown in the first image and use it as a repeating tile pattern to completely cover the entire [surface 1] surface in the second image. Tile this pattern repeatedly across the full [surface 1] from floor to ceiling with no gaps."

   FOR TWO SURFACES:
   "Take the texture/material shown in the first image and use it as a repeating tile pattern to completely cover the entire [surface 1] surface in the second image as well as the entire [surface 2] surface. Tile this pattern repeatedly across the full [surface 1] and [surface 2] from floor to ceiling with no gaps."

   CRITICAL PHRASING RULES:
   - Use "the texture/material shown in the first image" (covers tiles, wood, wallpaper, etc.)
   - Use "use it as a repeating tile pattern" (makes tiling action explicit)
   - Use "to completely cover the entire [surface] surface"
   - Use "Tile this pattern repeatedly across the full [surface]"
   - End with "from floor to ceiling with no gaps"
   - Always use "the entire" and "the full" for emphasis
   - Keep it natural and flowing
   - ONLY list surfaces that were actually marked (have green dots)

REVISED EXAMPLES OF COMPLETE OUTPUTS:

Example 1 - Right Wall only:
"Take the texture/material shown in the first image and use it as a repeating tile pattern to completely cover the entire right wall surface in the second image. Tile this pattern repeatedly across the full right wall from floor to ceiling with no gaps."

Example 2 - Left Wall + Right Wall:
"Take the texture/material shown in the first image and use it as a repeating tile pattern to completely cover the entire left wall surface in the second image as well as the entire right wall surface. Tile this pattern repeatedly across the full left wall and right wall from floor to ceiling with no gaps."

Example 3 - Right Wall + Floor:
"Take the texture/material shown in the first image and use it as a repeating tile pattern to completely cover the entire right wall surface in the second image as well as the entire floor surface. Tile this pattern repeatedly across the full right wall from floor to ceiling and across the full floor with no gaps."

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:
- INPUT (to you): Image 1 (textureImage - material reference) + Image 2 (markedImage - room with GREEN DOT marker on floor)
- OUTPUT (from you): A complete prompt for Gemini to replace the floor
- CRITICAL: Gemini will receive TWO images: [Image 1 (texture), unmarked original room, your prompt]
- Gemini will NOT see the green dot - you must convert the dot into spatial text descriptions of the floor

🎯 YOUR TASK - DETECT FLOOR AND DESCRIBE ITS BOUNDARIES:

STEP 1 - CONFIRM GREEN DOT IS ON FLOOR:
□ Look for BRIGHT GREEN circle (color #00FF00) in Image 2
□ Confirm it's on the floor (horizontal surface in lower portion of image)
□ If dot is NOT on floor, output "ERROR: No floor marked"

STEP 2 - ANALYZE FLOOR BOUNDARIES:
Carefully examine where the floor starts and ends in the image:

A. LEFT BOUNDARY:
   - Does the floor extend to the left edge of the image?
   - Is there a wall, furniture, or object on the left side?
   - Example: "The floor starts at the left edge" OR "The floor starts below the left wall"

B. RIGHT BOUNDARY:
   - Does the floor extend to the right edge of the image?
   - Is there a wall, furniture, or object on the right side?
   - Example: "The floor extends to the right edge" OR "The floor ends at the right wall base"

C. FRONT BOUNDARY (bottom of image):
   - Usually the floor extends to the bottom edge of the frame
   - Example: "The floor runs to the bottom edge of the image"

D. BACK BOUNDARY (where floor meets far wall):
   - Where does the visible floor end in the distance?
   - Is there a back wall visible?
   - Example: "The floor extends back to the far wall" OR "The floor continues to the back wall"

E. VISIBLE OBSTACLES:
   - Are there objects ON the floor (furniture, toilet, fixtures)?
   - Note: "There is a [object] on the floor"

STEP 3 - CONSTRUCT THE GEMINI PROMPT WITH DETAILED FLOOR DESCRIPTION:

FORMAT:
"Take the texture/material shown in the first image and use it as a repeating tile pattern to completely cover the entire floor surface in the second image. Tile this pattern repeatedly across the full floor with no gaps. The floor [detailed spatial description of boundaries and extent]."

The detailed spatial description should include:
- Where the floor starts (left/right/front boundaries)
- Where the floor extends to (edges, walls)
- Any notable features (runs under furniture, extends to far wall, etc.)

EXAMPLE OUTPUTS:

Example 1 - Open floor:
"Take the texture/material shown in the first image and use it as a repeating tile pattern to completely cover the entire floor surface in the second image. Tile this pattern repeatedly across the full floor with no gaps. The floor extends from the left edge to the right edge of the image and runs from the bottom edge back to the far wall."

Example 2 - Floor with furniture:
"Take the texture/material shown in the first image and use it as a repeating tile pattern to completely cover the entire floor surface in the second image. Tile this pattern repeatedly across the full floor with no gaps. The floor starts at the left wall base, extends to the right edge, runs to the bottom of the image, and continues back to the far wall, passing under the visible furniture."

Example 3 - Bathroom floor:
"Take the texture/material shown in the first image and use it as a repeating tile pattern to completely cover the entire floor surface in the second image. Tile this pattern repeatedly across the full floor with no gaps.

YOUR RESPONSE MUST BE ONLY THE FINAL PROMPT - NOTHING ELSE!

❌ DO NOT WRITE: "STEP 1", "STEP 2", "STEP 3" or any step labels
❌ DO NOT WRITE: "Looking at the images", "I found", "I can see", "The green dot"
❌ DO NOT explain your process, reasoning, or analysis
❌ DO NOT describe what you see - just output the prompt
❌ DO NOT show your work

✅ WRITE ONLY: The prompt that starts with "Take the texture/material shown in the first image..."

Your ENTIRE response must be TWO SENTENCES:
1. The main instruction (Take the texture... with no gaps.)
2. The floor boundary description (The floor [spatial details].)

Start directly with "Take the texture/material..." - nothing before or after.`
