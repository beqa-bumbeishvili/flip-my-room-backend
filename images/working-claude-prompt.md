I have two images: Image 1 shows white marble with gray veining (the texture I want). Image 2 shows a bathroom with gray tiles (the room to edit).

Task: Replace ALL the gray marble tiles in the bathroom (Image 2) with the white marble pattern from Image 1. This is a material replacement, NOT an image blend or merge.

Requirements:
- Keep the exact bathroom layout, camera angle, and perspective from Image 2
- Preserve all fixtures: toilet, sink, vanity, mirror, towel warmer, ceiling lights, and electrical outlet
- Maintain the original lighting, shadows, and reflections
- Only change the tile surfaces (walls, floor, and ceiling) from gray to white marble
- Apply the white marble texture and veining pattern from Image 1 to all tile surfaces
- Do not extend, expand, or add new elements to the scene
- The result should be the same bathroom view with different tile color/texture only
- Ensure photorealistic quality with proper depth and lighting consistency
- No blending of the two images - use Image 1 only as a texture reference for the tiles in Image 2
